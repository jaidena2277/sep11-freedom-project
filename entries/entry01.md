In this freedom projct I have had weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Have multiple options to pick from like [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) or [Melon.js](https://melonjs.org/) or even [Impact.js. ](https://impactjs.com/) These three options I have are all from the tier 2 tools out of the three tiers. I feel like I am comfortable with tier 2 and the tools in here are awesome. Out of all the options I have picked Kaboom.js. I feel like its a great tool to pick and very easy to understand. The documentation is easily accessible and well written. I am going to make a platform game collaborating with two of my friends to make the best platform game possible. A platform game is bisically like mario or doodle jump where your character is on a platform and has to jump over blocks or jump to the next platform. In terms of EDP I am on steps one I am defining the problem and working to step 2. For skills I would say I Am going to use collaboration by collaborating with my partners and Also Communicating for when I get stuck with coding I can communicate and understand the problems
