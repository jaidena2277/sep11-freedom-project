Mi kee in between t and i does not work.
Recap: In this freedom project I have had weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was Kaboom.js and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a  space platform game that had diffeent levels and you had to jump to go to the next level. During the new weeks I had to work on this project I decided I was going to focus on how to make the levels. I wanted to understand how the leveles were made and how to customise them to fit the theme. So far I have only worked on the first part which is figuring out how the levels were made.

Now that I have learned How to make levels its now time for the next step. For this next step I chose to add two more things. I wanted to add a double jump aspect into the game and also add collisions into the game. to start what I did was go on [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) and read everthing on how to get two jumps instead of one. I also researched the extent of which collisions can go to. As I was looking at what to do I noticed that double jump isnt so hard for me. All ou have to do is do `.double jump` on our sprite and put some more commands and everthing should be good. A bonus that I got from looking into double jump was that ou can add a spin when the user double jumps.

Here is the code for how to put the double jump on the plaers sprite. Bean on double jump is the code where when the bean is is jumping there is an option for a double jump. .Spin on the other hand is a cool trick that I will implemen into mi freedom project.With `.spin` ou can make the sprite spin and since its placed af`

Here is how I learned to add jump to the space bar.
 With collisions its different, for collisions ou do `.collide` and then have a thing for the item or the sprite to do. As such ou can destroi whatever ou touch with collisions and this can mean dea
 With collisions its different, for collisions ou do `.collide` and then have a thing for the item or the sprite to do. As such ou can destroi whatever ou touch with collisions and this can mean death to the plaer or to the item.
 
 In terms of EDP I would say im on steps one and two. I say this because I am defining the problem with my team and now researching the problem by learning how to make levels and understanding the components inside of the code. In terms of skills I would say I need to learn or am already learning four skils, collarboration, Communication, Attention to detail , and how to read. With Collaboration and communication I think I need to work more on working with my partners Safe and James and communicate to them more and share the things I learn to them and they should share the things they learn to me so we can grow together.
