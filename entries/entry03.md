Recap: In this freedom projct I have had weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was Kaboom.js and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a  space platform game that had diffeent levels and you had to jump to go to the next level. During the new weeks I had to work on this project I decided I was going to focus on how to make the levels. I wanted to understand how the leveles were made and how to customise them to fit the theme. So far I have only worked on the first part which is figuring out how the levels were made.

Now that I have learned How to make levels its now time for the next step. For this next step I chose to add two more things. I wanted to add a double jump aspect into the game and also add collisions into the game. to start what I did was go on [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) and read everthing on how to get two jumps instead of one. I also researched the extent of which collisions can go to. As I was looking at what to do I noticed that double jump isnt so hard for me. All ou have to do is do .double jump on our sprite and put some more commands and everthing should be good. A bonus that I got from looking into double jump was that ou can add a spin when the user double jumps.
