# Entry 6
##### X/X/XX

Recap: During the entire school year I have been working on a project  called the freedom project which every student is required to do. Every monday we woulld work on said project and for the project you could have up to 3 partners. I decided to work on this project all year with two friends of mine.  For th eproject we had the option to pick whatever we felt like making whether it be a game or a website of whatever you feel most passionate about. My partners and I decided on a game which would be a platform game. Kind of like mario. The goal was to pick a tool to help us make the project and spend every monday working on the project. We picked [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) which is a tool that has a lot of documentation to help us understand all the syntax and give us a headstart on the project.

The first section that I want to go over in this entry is the in class presentations. After working on our projects for the whole year, we had to present them to our classmates and we got to pick the order in which we wanted to go in. Originally We wanted to go first to get it over and done with. Nothing ever works out how we want it and right as we had to fill out the form, one of us notices a bug in our code. We were not able to play our game due to this bug which was that the gravity syntax was not working and for some reason it made the whole game a black screen and had an error pop up. We were so scared that we spent so much time into making our game just for it not to work in the end even though we were playing it fine and had great feedback from our classmates about the game. the number range on which we present went from one to five in order from going first to going last. Since we fouund out this bug we were forced to go last in order to have a little bit more time
