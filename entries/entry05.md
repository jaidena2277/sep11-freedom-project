Recap: In this freedom project I have had multiple weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a space platform game that had diffeent levels and you had to jump to go to the next level. So far I have learned how to make the levels, add difficulty to them, and make an ai that acts as the enemy. The goal for the weeks I had to work on this was to build an MVP(Most Viable Product) for my freedom project. All my partners and I have to do is add everything we have learned and compile it into a single game.

Challenge: To start this off the first challenge I had was not so much the levels but the problem the level caused. All i had to do was make three levels for the MVP, one would be easy the next is medium and the last is hard. The problem I had was the size of the blocks and enemy ai. The way I initially designed the levels was for there to be blocks you need to jump on top of in order to avoid touching the ai or spikes.
