Recap: In this freedom projct I have had weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was Kaboom.js and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a platform game that had diffeent levelsand you had to jump to go to the next level. During the new weeks I had to work on this roject I decided I was going to focus on how to make the levels. I wanted to understand how the leveles were made and how to customise them to fit the theme. So far I have only worked on the first part which is figuring out how the levels were made.

Now as we head into actually coding the project we start with defining the level.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91745222/214088067-04eab7ce-9bfe-488f-a646-a5443e6137e8.png)
