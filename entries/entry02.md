Recap: In this freedom projct I have had weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was Kaboom.js and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a platform game that had diffeent levelsand you had to jump to go to the next level. During the new weeks I had to work on this roject I decided I was going to focus on how to make the levels. I wanted to understand how the leveles were made and how to customise them to fit the theme. So far I have only worked on the first part which is figuring out how the levels were made.

Now as we head into actually coding the project we start with defining the level. The first thing I did was design the level. What I noticed during the coding was that the "," was a crucial part of the code. Without the "," the code wouldnt work and it would be a blank screen.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91745222/214090306-de2b188c-b12c-43d9-b064-7d1815797a66.png)

As you can see the code works well and the commas are there. But in this example just one comma is gone and the whole code is ruined.

Here is with the comma:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91745222/214090776-4c8927b9-3110-4811-879d-f2398c1b7bd7.png)

Here is without the comma:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91745222/214090895-ba1972d9-0a11-4a1c-a831-589cd4d642e6.png)
The next discovery that I made was that you need to have the commas over the entire code for it to work and not in the spot you want the item or block to appear. I was trying to make it to where I put the comma "=" directly above the rest of the code like this:   
```js
        "="
"============"
```
This is incorrect and you have to make the commas the same length as the commas below it so like this: "        ="
                                                                                                       "========="
