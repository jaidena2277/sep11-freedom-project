Recap: In this freedom project I have had multiple weeks to tinker and think about what tool I would like to use for it. I Had multiple options to pick from like Kaboom.js or Melon.js or even Impact.js. The tool I chose was Kaboom.js and I believe it was the right choice. My project was about a space platform game that had diffeent levels and you had to jump to go to the next level. So far I have learned how to make the levels and and add cool twists to each level. I only have a few weeks left before the mvp is due. With this in mind I now have to figure out how to make enemy ai for our levels which was quite a difficult task.

Building this ai enemy took a lot out of me. I had alot of trouble understanding the syntax of how to make the ai move on its own and be able to bump into walls and turn around. As I started working on making the ai I realized that it would be smarter to make the body of the ai because I found out that you had to identify your sprite with any class. I identified the sprite as class "enemy",
