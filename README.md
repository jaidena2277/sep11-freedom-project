## Implications
The game that my team and I created has impacts on all three catagories of society,global and economic. For society, This game helps build your perseverance as an indivisual due to the game being a bit tricky and you may die a lot. On the other hand, this game also brings friendly compitition to relationships as it can build bonds between others by racing on who can beat the game first. The impact it has on culture especially bringing people from all over the world to play with each other or compete aginst each other. FOr ecomonics, many people can get jobs by acting as a person in an advertisement which benefits both the game and the job worker. For global, it can be said that our game can help society as a whole advance in the future as our game teaches important lessons that dont seem big but have a big effect on the world because as more people play the game and learn things such as adaptation and other skills it may just effect the humanns of the future.
